Web-Based Healthcare Chatbot for Non-Severe Health Guidance

This project presents a web-based healthcare chatbot developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system is designed to provide basic health-related information and general wellness guidance for common, non-severe conditions. The chatbot aims to improve health awareness and promote informed decision-making while clearly avoiding medical diagnosis, prescription, or emergency advice. The application runs entirely on the client side and requires no backend infrastructure.

 Objectives
- To design and implement a simple healthcare chatbot using front-end web technologies  
- To provide basic health guidance for minor and non-critical conditions  
- To promote health awareness and preventive care practices  
- To ensure ethical boundaries by excluding severe disease diagnosis and treatment  

Scope of the Project
The chatbot is limited to providing information related to:
- Mild symptoms (e.g., headache, common cold, fatigue)
- Basic lifestyle and wellness tips
- Preventive health advice

The system does not handle:
- Severe or chronic diseases
- Emergency medical situations
- Diagnostic or prescription-based responses

Technologies Used
- HTML – Used to structure the chatbot interface  
- CSS – Used for layout design, styling, and responsiveness  
- JavaScript – Used to implement chatbot logic and user interaction  

 System Architecture
The application follows a client-side architecture where:
- User input is captured via the web interface  
- JavaScript processes the input using predefined logic and keyword matching  
- Appropriate responses are displayed dynamically
