# Healthcare Chatbot for Basic Health Assistance  

## Project Overview  
This project presents a **web-based Healthcare Chatbot** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, aimed at providing **basic health guidance for non-severe medical conditions**. The system is designed for **educational and informational purposes only**, focusing on general wellness, preventive care, and common day-to-day health concerns.

The chatbot does **not** perform medical diagnosis, prescribe medication, or handle emergency or critical health conditions.

- General fatigue and stress  
- Hydration, sleep, and basic wellness tips  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure and layout of the web application
